# D3_Challenge_ANT
This challenge was to take a data set which contained data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. I selected Poverty versus healthcare and created a scatter plot.

When you move your mouse over one of the data points, the State, Poverty % and Healthcare % are both displayed.

Overall the most challenging part of this assignment was to add the state abbreviations onto the scatterplot.
